# 📊 Covariance, Correlation & Regression Analysis – SAS & Excel

This repository contains the academic project that I undertook for the course **Computer Applications for Marketing Analytics (MKTG 744)** at **Centennial College**. The objective was to perform exploratory and inferential statistical analysis using **SAS Enterprise Guide** and **Microsoft Excel** on two datasets: stock performance and consumer product purchasing behavior.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Conduct covariance and correlation analysis on stock and product data.
- Analyze relationships between income and consumer spending via regression.
- Use SAS and Excel to run statistical tests and build forecasting models.
- Interpret real-world business implications from data insights.

## 🔍 Key Analyses

### 📈 Task 1: Covariance and Correlation

#### ✅ Stock Data
- Stocks Analyzed: **i-80 Gold Corp (IAU.TO)**, **Baytex Energy Corp (BTE.TO)**, **Aurora Cannabis Inc. (ACB.TO)**
- **Investment Suggestion**: BTE and ACB showed higher returns and are positively correlated, making them the best pair to invest in based on historical data.

#### ✅ Product Data
- **Income vs Education** → Correlation = **0.917** → Strong positive relationship  
- **Fruits vs Sweet Products** → Correlation = **0.453** → Moderate positive relationship

### 📊 Task 2: Regression Analysis

- **Model Equation**:  
  _y = 0.0311x - 1060.3_  
  Where `y = Total Amount Spent`, `x = Income`

- **Hypothesis Testing**:  
  - H₀: No relationship between income and spending  
  - H₁: Significant relationship exists  
  - **p-value < 0.0001** → Reject H₀ → There **is** a significant relationship

- **R² = 0.6866** → The model explains ~69% of variation in spending

#### 📌 Prediction Scenario:
- Average income = **$62,926**
- Increase income by $10,000 → Predicted spending = **$1,207.69**
- Confidence interval (± standard error):  
  - **Lower limit** = $734.93  
  - **Upper limit** = $1,680.45
